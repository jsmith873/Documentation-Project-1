I began my design planning by reviewing the various data files we had been provided and decided how best to make use of the data contained within each. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to end up with 4 graphs. I wanted a graph of the map of London to the left of the screen and a bar chart timeline graph in the upper right hand corner of the screen with two pie charts for age and gender breakdowns underneath the bar chart but still next to the map. Ideally, I wanted to have the bottom of the pie charts match up to the bottom of the map. I have provided a sketch of the desired layout below <br />
